## Bedrock Knowledge Bases

###  Can I configure role-based access for Bedrock Knowledge Bases?
Yes, our CDK includes sample context passing to the Bedrock agent when invoking.

See [this AWS blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/machine-learning/access-control-for-vector-stores-using-metadata-filtering-with-knowledge-bases-for-amazon-bedrock/)
:::

###  Can I use nested JSON for metadata in Knowledge Bases?
No, KB metadata cannot be nested JSON. It will result in an error.

## Bedrock Agents

###  How can I make certain parameters optional in Bedrock Agent actions?
Use Python's `Optional` type and provide a default value:
```python
from typing import Annotated, Optional

def password_change(email: str, phone: Optional[str] = None):
    # Function logic
```

###  How can I improve Bedrock Agent response times?
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Quick Fixes">
    1. Increase Lambda size if response processing is slow
    2. Limit response length using prompts
    3. Use KB metadata filtering
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Long-term Solutions">
    1. Consider Provisioned Throughput
    2. Limit number of actions (Soft limit: 11)
    3. Implement a caching layer
    4. Use multiple agents if needed
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

###  How do I handle "max iterations exceeded" errors?
This is a hard limit set by Bedrock. To address this:
- Ensure requests aren't stuck in loops
- Optimize your action invocations
- Use session attributes to avoid redundant calls
- Consider making parameters optional
- Limit the number of APIs available

:::tip[Reference]
See [this AWS repost](https://repost.aws/questions/QUazRyCtdbSvqFV2fWJMzu3A/aws-bedrock-agent-failurereason-max-iterations-exceeded)
:::

###  Should an agent use multiple action groups?
Agents work best with a small number of actions (soft limit: 11 actions and knowledge bases per agent). Consider creating separate agents for different tasks.

[See quotas documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/quotas.html)

## Prompt Engineering

###  What are the best practices for prompt engineering?
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Key Principles">
    1. **Clarity and Specificity**: Clear, concise, specific prompts
    2. **Context and Examples**: Provide relevant context and examples
    3. **Iterative Refinement**: Continuously evaluate and adjust
  </TabItem>

## Workshop Setup

###  Why am I getting "ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_EXEC_FIRST_FAIL"?
This typically occurs when you're not in the correct directory. Ensure you are in the project's root directory when running pnpm commands.

###  How can I fix "ERR_PNPM_RECURSIVE_RUN_FIRST_FAIL"?
Increase Node.js memory allocation:
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=8192 pnpm yourcommand
```

###  How can I manage dependencies using pnpm?
Common commands:
```bash
pnpm install    # Install all dependencies
pnpm update     # Update all dependencies
pnpm build      # Build all applications
pnpm deploy     # Deploy CDK infrastructure
```

### Why am I getting "Named export MODULE NAME not found. The requested module MODULE PATH is a CommonJS module, which may not support all module.exports as named exports."?

This happens when vite tries to externalize dependencies for SSR (Server Side Rendering). For astro-docs, this only works for libraries that export code as ESM, during build time.

To fix this, add the name of the module you are getting errors from, as part of the `ssr.noExternal` list of values withing the `docs/astro-docs/astro.config.mjs` to prevent the dependency from being externalized for SSR.

```json
	vite: {
		ssr: {
			noExternal: [
        'entities'
      ]
		}
	}
```

## Costs and Security

###  How much does the workshop cost?
:::note[Cost Breakdown]
- Most services use AWS Free Tier
- OpenSearch Serverless: ~$700-800/month
- Bedrock: Pay-as-you-go
- CloudWatch Dashboard provides token usage estimates
:::

###  How does API Gateway authorize requests?
The workshop uses AWS Lambda Authorizer as an example. The API gateway requires an authentication header in the request.

###  What is the Chat Summary Construct?
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Overview">
    - Provides conversation summaries
    - Uses Claude 3 Haiku model
    - Accessible via `/chat-summary` endpoint
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="vs Memory Retention">
    - Memory Retention is native to Bedrock Agent
    - Chat Summary is a one-time request
    - Memory Retention stores for 1-30 days
    - Chat Summary can be stored indefinitely
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

###  Why don't I see metrics in the CloudWatch dashboard?
If metrics are missing:
1. Verify correct model ID for your region
2. Check model ARN in code (default region: `us-west-2`)
3. Update region-specific settings if needed
4. Redeploy after making changes
