## Resource Cleanup Process

:::caution[Before You Begin]
Consider keeping the resources if you're unsure about removing them. They can be valuable for future use.
:::

<Steps>
1. **Destroy CDK Stacks**
   ```bash
   pnpm cdk_infra:destroy
   ```
   :::note
   This command will destroy the CDK application without confirmation prompts.
   :::

2. **Verify Resource Deletion**
   - Navigate to [CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)
   - Confirm all stacks have been removed
   - Check for any failed deletions

3. **Manual Cleanup (If Needed)**
   - Force delete any remaining resources
   - Check related services for lingering components
