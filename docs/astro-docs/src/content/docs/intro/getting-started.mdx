This workshop provides a CDK scaffolding for rapid prototyping of AI-powered applications using Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases and Agents.

The full-stack template includes pre-built infrastructure, sample implementations, and customizable components that you can use to quickly build and validate your own Generative AI solutions powered by AWS.

## Purpose

* Accelerate development with production-ready infrastructure templates
* Enable quick proof-of-concept development for custom use cases
* Demonstrate best practices for integrating Amazon Bedrock services

## Prerequisites

### Required AWS Setup

<Steps>
  1. **AWS Account Access**
     - Ensure you have administrative access to your AWS account

  2. **Amazon Bedrock Model Access**
     - Claude (Sonnet 3, 3.5) for Bedrock Agent
     - Titan Embeddings v2 for Knowledge Base
     - Nova Lite for Chat Summary (Optional)

  3. **CDK Bootstrap**
     - Bootstrap CDK in your target region (Recommended: `us-west-2` or `us-east-1`)
     ```bash
     cdk bootstrap aws://ACCOUNT-NUMBER/REGION
     ```
     :::note
     If using a different region, ensure [the AWS services](/applications/cdk-infra-guide) and [foundation models](/getting-started/#required-aws-setup) are supported in your chosen region.
